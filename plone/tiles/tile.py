    The tile is basically a browser view, with the following enhancements:

    * The attribute `data` can be used to read the tile data, as returned by
      `ITileDataManager(tile).get()`. This value is cached when it is first
      read.
    * The attribute `url` can be used to obtain the tile's URL, including the
      id specifier and any data associated with a transient tile. Again, the
      return value is cached after the first access.
    * The class implements __getitem__() to set the tile id from the traversal
      sub-path, as well as to allow views to be looked up. This is what allows
      a URL like `http://.../@@example.tile/foo` to result in a tile with id
      `foo`.
